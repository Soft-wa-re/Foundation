1. Democracy
Employees should be able to elect their manager.
Employees should be able to ifre their CEO and anyone else on the board of directors.

2. Compensation
Employees should be able to self-organize onto scrum teams. Breaking their work down into units of work.
The employees will then be able to review, and approve work done.  Work done units will be tied directly to compensation.  
Compensation will come either as cash or equity.

3. Transparency
Increased transparency is needed of companies with their employees, customers, and general public.

Why?
One driver of this is because we see the power and influence these unelected corporations have over our government. We aim to rectify this so that corporations are accountable to someone.  In this case their employees.
